My name is Keyaedisa! You can call me Key for short. I am a 22 year old developer and junior security researcher. I am nonbinary and my pronouns are they/them. I am self taught and really enjoy the challenge of teaching my self what it takes. I am apart of the team at XeroLinux and responsible for the program known as abs used to build the Xero and XeroG ISO&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>newKai + newKaiso</title><link>https://keyaedisa.github.io/projects/newkai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:57:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.github.io/projects/newkai/</guid><description>newKai is the successor to a project I called Kairo. Kairo was my first attempt at building my own Arch ISO. Kairo used Arco&amp;rsquo;s base. newKai was created because I quickly realized Kairo was not truly a custom Arch ISO. Since it used a lot of Arco&amp;rsquo;s stuff it was really just a custom Arco ISO. newKai was created to remedy this.
As development on newKai moved forward a few core ideals were realized.</description></item><item><title>ValenOS</title><link>https://keyaedisa.github.io/projects/valenos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:57:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.github.io/projects/valenos/</guid><description>ValenOS is the successor to newKai. After all the time I spent working on newKai, I realized it had become kind of unique to my Macbook&amp;rsquo;s hardware. ValenOS was created to bring the fixes I made for my Macbook&amp;rsquo;s family of network cards to other Macbook&amp;rsquo;s, but also make it installable on different hardware.
There are some differences between newKai but ultimately I realized I was just fine with using Xero and so now it serves as a private project I can test things on.</description></item><item><title>ValenSE</title><link>https://keyaedisa.github.io/projects/valense/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:57:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.github.io/projects/valense/</guid><description>ValenSE is the ISO I built for my server. I have a server I use and maintain for data storage purposes as well hosting my own website and potentially minecraft server.
It taught me alot about how to setup Linux and a bootloader for a BIOS non-UEFI system. It is a command line only OS and comes bundled only with what&amp;rsquo;s needed to boot live and install. It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be an Arch based OS that is just right for those who need a server OS and nothing more.</description></item><item><title>Beginning of my blog!</title><link>https://keyaedisa.github.io/posts/beginningofblog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 21:00:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.github.io/posts/beginningofblog/</guid><description>Welcome to my blog!

It adds several options over 2.0. abs 3.0&amp;rsquo;s presence in the terminal is also different than that of 2.0. It has been redesigned to be simpler yet still retaining the color and liveliness of abs 2.0. Output has been streamlined and it is overall a big improvement over 2.0.
