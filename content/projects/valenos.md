ValenOS is the successor to newKai. After all the time I spent working
on newKai, I realized it had become kind of unique to my Macbook's
hardware. ValenOS was created to bring the fixes I made for my Macbook's
family of network cards to other Macbook's, but also make it installable
on different hardware.

There are some differences between newKai but ultimately I realized I was
just fine with using Xero and so now it serves as a private project I can
test things on. It also became the base for ValenSE which is just the
server edition of Valen. It can be found on my github however it's not
complete so mileage varies.

## Update

I've put this project to the side as I work on getting into the Darwin/XNU space.
