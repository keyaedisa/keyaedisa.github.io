# Project Scope

abs 3.0 will be the first version of abs to offer a GUI!


Additionally, the goals with abs 3.0 are as follows

1. GUI
2. Allow the user even deeper customization of their ISO
3. Error catching
4. Useable on any operating system
5. Helping the user with the install process from the live ISO
6. and more!

abs 3.0 will be a revolutionary jump in the custom archiso space and will make
creating your own custom arch iso trivial! This should help make arch more
interesting to those who may be nervous to get into arch, especially when it
comes to building their own ISO. Of course, you will still need to have some
sort of background knowledge but the main goal with abs is to streamline every
part of the ISO creation and build process so that even newbies can build an ISO
with confidence. If anyone is interested in getting involved with the project,
please feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/keyaedisa)!
