abs 3.0 is another rewrite of abs. It adds several options over 2.0.
abs 3.0's presence in the terminal is also different than that of 2.0.
It has been redesigned to be simpler yet still retaining the color and
liveliness of abs 2.0. Output has been streamlined and it is overall a
big improvement over 2.0.

The project repo can be found at [abs github](https://github.com/keyaedisa/abs)!

One of the biggest features now available in abs 3.0 is the option to
build the latest Pure Vanilla Arch Monthly ISO's. abs 3.0 allows you
to choose between the typical Vanilla Arch ISO experience (releng) and
the option of going for the bare minimal version of Vanilla Arch built 
with Arch's own baseline profile. It builds an ISO that has near only
exactly what it needs to boot on a live medium.

abs 3.0 also has a reworked help option. "abs -h" will bring up a list of
all options and a brief description. "abs --help" will bring up a more
detailed description of each option.

abs 3.0 finally publicly includes an option we have been testing in
secret for quite some time now. The option to build an official
Gnome Edition Xero ISO! This is something that's been in the works for
months and is now officially apart of abs.

There is also now a -L option which list's all of abs 3.0's options.

I hope you all enjoy abs 3.0 and I would like to share how thankful I
am that you all have embraced abs. I am honored to be able to provide
this utility to the greater Arch community and I look forward to
continuing to improve it for everyone. Thanks!
