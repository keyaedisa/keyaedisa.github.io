ValenSE is the ISO I built for my server. I have a server I use and
maintain for data storage purposes as well hosting my own website and
potentially minecraft server.

It taught me alot about how to setup Linux and a bootloader for a BIOS
non-UEFI system. It is a command line only OS and comes bundled only
with what's needed to boot live and install. It's meant to be an Arch
based OS that is just right for those who need a server OS and nothing
more. I use it currently and it works well for me. It can be found on
my github however it's a bit specialized to my hardware. If there were
to be interest in it by others it'd be no problem setting it up to work
on any other hardware. Earlier versions did before I stripped the support
when testing on my box.
