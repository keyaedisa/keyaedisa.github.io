# Welcome
Hi all. In this post I will be updating you all on what I am currently working on. See below:


# abu
abu is an in development terminual utility written in C and bash. It starts an ncurses TUI that makes the archiso creation process newbie friendly.
abs will be deprecated on abu's first release.

Project goals
- multiple user profiles that can be passed to custom
- add/delete/modify user profiles
- attractive tui thats easy to use

# ValenSE
Yes I am picking ValenSE up again. Server was dormant for a bit but is now up and running once more. More on this later.

Project goals
- remove all unnecessary modules, pkgs etc
- create TUI installer to bundle with liveiso
- set refind as main bootloader for live and installed root

# ValenOS
Valen may also see some attention. The idea is to use SE as it's base and OS have: dwm, ly, option to install WM of choice.
Bundle with Pi.

# Pi
Pi is the first thing I ever wrote. Written in Java; Pi is my ai. She will need a rewrite in C.

Project goals
- schedule assistant
- git helper
- abu integration
- chatGPT
- system assistant (you basically tell Pi to do something and it happens i.e. "Pi shutdown my pc" etc
