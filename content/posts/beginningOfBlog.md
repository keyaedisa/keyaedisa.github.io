# Welcome to my blog!

Hello all! I'm Keyaedisa or Key for short! I am 22 years old and nonbinary. My
pronouns are they/them. I am a developer who is also getting into the cyber
security space. I plan on opening up my own security firm someday and getting
into the iOS security space. I am passionate about nearly all things technology
and love learning more. I have been learning a lot about programming and linux
this past year. I use arch btw!

# Goals for the coming year

This upcoming year I intend on completing my cyber security program and
officially breaking into that space. I want to continue on my pursuit of
knowledge in all things programming and cyber security. I would really like to
finish abs 3.0 and maybe do some tinkering with iOS exploitation using already
known vulnerabilities. It would also be amazing to meet people in the cyber
security or programming industries and build my connections and friendships. I
am always open to new peers!

# Plans for this blog

I am not sure what will become of this blog. It would be neat to grow this as a
platform. Surely I will make new blog posts at least to update whoever cares
about my adventures. We will see. If you've made it this far, I heart you!
