Hello! My name is Keyaedisa! You can call me Key for short. I am
a 22 year old developer and junior security researcher. I am nonbinary
and my pronouns are they/them. I am self taught and really enjoy the
challenge of teaching my self what it takes. I am apart of the team at [XeroLinux](https://xerolinux.xyz)
and responsible for the program known as [abs](https://github.com/keyaedisa/abs)
used to build the Xero and XeroG ISO's. I am a fan of all things
tech, science, and space. I love cars as well as drifting.
