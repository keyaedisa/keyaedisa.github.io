      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ssh-tips-and-tricks&#34;&gt;SSH Tips and Tricks!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi! I was inspired to make a post about SSH that could be used as a somewhat quick reference for some basic SSH commands and tips and tricks regarding proper usage practices.&#xA;Below you will find summaries of a few articles I found to have useful information. This way I felt would be better both for me writing this blog quickly and also for allowing you the reader to quickly read and decide what reference you actually need.&#xA;Where possible, you should definitely use SSH authentication. Not only because it&amp;rsquo;s more secure, but also because it&amp;rsquo;s a really good way to speed up your workflow especially if you live in the terminal like me! I know that many of you have workflows that aren&amp;rsquo;t terminal centric and if they work for you then great! I will however advocate that you do learn how to live in a terminal as it can significantly speed up your work flow! No need to traverse ui&amp;rsquo;s and bounce around apps when you can do most if not all of it in the terminal ya know? Anyways, below you can find some good refs and their summaries!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
