      <description>newKai newKai is the successor to a project I called Kairo. Kairo was my first attempt at building my own Arch ISO. Kairo used Arco&amp;rsquo;s base. newKai was created because I quickly realized Kairo was not truly a custom Arch ISO. Since it used a lot of Arco&amp;rsquo;s stuff it was really just a custom Arco ISO. newKai was created to remedy this.
As development on newKai moved forward a few core ideals were realized.</description>

      <description>ABS 3.0 abs 3.0 is another rewrite of abs. It adds several options over 2.0. abs 3.0&amp;rsquo;s presence in the terminal is also different than that of 2.0. It has been redesigned to be simpler yet still retaining the color and liveliness of abs 2.0. Output has been streamlined and it is overall a big improvement over 2.0.
The project repo can be found at abs github!
One of the biggest features now available in abs 3.</description>

      <description>Intro The most recent compiled version of abs is hosted on my package repo called Valen and can be found at Valen Repo!
The project repo can be found at abs github!
abs is a terminal utility I wrote in bash meant to not only automate the build process of any archiso profile it is provided, but to also make it an interative process. It allows you to customize the contents of your profiledef.</description>
