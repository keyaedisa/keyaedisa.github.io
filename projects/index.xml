&lt;p>This is my nano config. It&amp;rsquo;s for Valen and I hope to bundle it with Xero soon.

Kairo was my first
attempt at building my own Arch ISO. Kairo used Arco&amp;rsquo;s base. newKai was
created because I quickly realized Kairo was not truly a custom Arch ISO.
Since it used a lot of Arco&amp;rsquo;s stuff it was really just a custom Arco ISO.
newKai was created to remedy this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As development on newKai moved forward a few core ideals were realized.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ValenOS</title><link>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/valenos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:57:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/valenos/</guid><description>&lt;p>ValenOS is the successor to newKai. After all the time I spent working
on newKai, I realized it had become kind of unique to my Macbook&amp;rsquo;s
hardware. ValenOS was created to bring the fixes I made for my Macbook&amp;rsquo;s
family of network cards to other Macbook&amp;rsquo;s, but also make it installable
on different hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some differences between newKai but ultimately I realized I was
just fine with using Xero and so now it serves as a private project I can
test things on. It also became the base for ValenSE which is just the
server edition of Valen. It can be found on my github however it&amp;rsquo;s not
complete so mileage varies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ValenSE</title><link>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/valense/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 17:57:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/valense/</guid><description>&lt;p>##Update&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently completely rebuilding ValenSE from ground up. It will
no longer come preinstalled with web server software or any of the
specific to my use case software I bundled originally. ValenSE has
been stripped of everything not essential to boot the LiveISO (this
includes everything needed to allow it to be a headless ISO. P.S.
SSH is only configured for my personal PC, you will need to add your
own keys), and the installation scripts will be rewritten in C and
also stripped of everything non-essential. The &amp;ldquo;completed&amp;rdquo; version
will be forked and serve as the new base for any potential future
ValenOS builds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>abs 3.0</title><link>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/abs3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 20:22:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/abs3/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://keyaedisa.world/images/abs3.png" alt="abs 3.0 preview" title="abs 3.0">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>abs 3.0 is another rewrite of abs. It adds several options over 2.0.
abs 3.0&amp;rsquo;s presence in the terminal is also different than that of 2.0.
It has been redesigned to be simpler yet still retaining the color and
liveliness of abs 2.0. Output has been streamlined and it is overall a
big improvement over 2.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project repo can be found at &lt;a href="https://github.com/keyaedisa/abs">abs github&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest features now available in abs 3.0 is the option to
build the latest Pure Vanilla Arch Monthly ISO&amp;rsquo;s. abs 3.0 allows you
to choose between the typical Vanilla Arch ISO experience (releng) and
the option of going for the bare minimal version of Vanilla Arch built
with Arch&amp;rsquo;s own baseline profile. It builds an ISO that has near only
exactly what it needs to boot on a live medium.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>abs 2.0!</title><link>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/abs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 19:54:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/abs/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://keyaedisa.world/images/abs.png" alt="abs 2.0 preview" title="abs 2.0">&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The most recent compiled version of abs is hosted on my package repo called Valen and
can be found at &lt;a href="https:github.com/keyaedisa/valen_repo">Valen Repo&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project repo can be found at &lt;a href="https://github.com/keyaedisa/abs">abs github&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>abs is a terminal utility I wrote in bash meant to not only automate the build
process of any archiso profile it is provided, but to also make it an
interative process. It allows you to customize the contents of your profiledef.sh
and dev-rel automatically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>abu!</title><link>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/abu/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 19:54:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/abu/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="abu">abu&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>abu is an in development terminual utility written in C and bash. It starts an ncurses TUI that makes the archiso creation process newbie friendly.
abs will be deprecated on abu&amp;rsquo;s first release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project goals&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>multiple user profiles that can be passed to custom&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add/delete/modify user profiles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>attractive tui thats easy to use&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>abu!</title><link>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/pi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 19:54:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://keyaedisa.world/projects/pi/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="pi">Pi&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Pi is the first thing I ever wrote. Written in Java; Pi is my ai. She will need a rewrite in C.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project goals&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>schedule assistant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>git helper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>abu integration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>chatGPT&lt;/li>
&lt;li>system assistant (you basically tell Pi to do something and it happens i.e. &amp;ldquo;Pi shutdown my pc&amp;rdquo; etc&lt;/li>
